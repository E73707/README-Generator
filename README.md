## description

    
A README file is a text file that provides information about an application. README generator uses Node.js, inquirer, and the fs (file system) module to prompt the user for information through the terminal. The user will be asked for a title, description of the application, installation instructions, usage examples, license information, and a list of contributors. The application will also prompt the user for information about any tests that have been conducted on the application, as well as the user's GitHub and email. Once all of the information has been collected, the application generates a professional README file using the input provided.
